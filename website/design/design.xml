  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>

This document describes the goals, operation, and testing procedures of the
Torbutton Firefox extension.

  </para>
  <sect2 id="adversary">
   <title>Adversary Model</title>
   <para>

A Tor web browser adversary has a number of goals, capabilities, and attack
types that can be used to guide us towards a set of requirements for the
Torbutton extension. Let's start with the Goals.

   </para>
   <sect3>
    <title>Adversary Goals</title>
    <orderedlist>
<!-- These aren't really commands.. But it's the closest I could find in an
acceptable style.. Don't really want to make my own stylesheet -->
     <listitem><command>Bypassing proxy settings</command>
     <para>The adversary's primary goal is direct compromise and bypass of 
Tor, causing the user to directly connect to an IP of the adversary's
choosing.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Correlation of Tor vs Non-Tor Activity</command>
     <para>If direct proxy bypass is not possible, the adversary will likely
happily settle for the ability to correlate something a user did via Tor with
their non-Tor activity. This can be done with cookies, cache identifiers,
javascript events, and even CSS.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>History disclosure</command>
     <para>
The adversary may also be interested in history disclosure: the ability to
query a user's history to see if they have issued certain censored search
queries, or visited censored sites.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Location information</command>
     <para>

Location information such as timezone and locality can be useful for the
adversary to determine if a user is in fact originating from one of the
regions they are attempting to control, or to zero-in on the geographical
location of a particular dissident or whistleblower.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Misc anonymity set reduction</command>
     <para>

Anonymity set reduction is also useful in attempting to zero in on a
particular individual. If the dissident or whistleblower is using a rare build
of Firefox for an obscure operating system, this can be very useful
information for tracking them down.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>History records and other on-disk
information</command>
     <para>
In some cases, the adversary may opt for a heavy-handed approach, such as
seizing the computers of all Tor users in an area (especially after narrowing
the field by the above two pieces of information). History records and cache
data are the primary goals here.
     </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>Adversary Capabilities - Positioning</title>
    <para>
The adversary can position themselves at a number of different locations in
order to execute their attacks.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Exit Node or Upstream Router</command>
     <para>
The adversary can run exit nodes, or alternatively, they may control routers
upstream of exit nodes. Both of these scenarios have been observed in the
wild.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Adservers and/or Malicious Websites</command>
     <para>
The adversary can also run websites, or more likely, they can contract out
ad space from a number of different adservers and inject content that way. For
some users, the adversary may be the adservers themselves. It is not
inconceivable that adservers may try to subvert or reduce a user's anonymity 
through Tor for marketing purposes.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Local Network/ISP/Upstream Router</command>
     <para>
The adversary can also inject malicious content at the user's upstream router
when they have Tor disabled, in an attempt to correlate their Tor and Non-Tor
activity.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Physical Access</command>
     <para>
Some users face adversaries with intermittent or constant physical access.
Users in Internet cafes, for example, face such a threat. In addition, in
countries where simply using tools like Tor is illegal, users may face
confiscation of their computer equipment for excessive Tor usage or just
general suspicion.
     </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>Adversary Capabilities - Attacks</title>
    <para>
The adversary can perform the following attacks from a number of different 
positions to accomplish various aspects of their goals.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Inserting Javascript</command>
     <para>
Javascript allows the adversary the opportunity to accomplish a number of
their goals. If not properly disabled, Javascript event handlers and timers
can cause the browser to perform network activity after Tor has been disabled,
thus allowing the adversary to correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity. Javascript
also allows the adversary to execute <ulink
url="http://gemal.dk/browserspy/css.html">history disclosure attacks</ulink>:
to query the history via the different attributes of 'visited' links. Finally,
Javascript can be used to query the user's timezone via the
<function>Date()</function> object, and to reduce the anonymity set by querying
the <function>navigator</function> object for operating system, CPU, and user
agent information.
     </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem><command>Inserting Plugins</command>
     <para>

Plugins are abysmal at obeying the proxy settings of the browser. Every plugin
capable of performing network activity that the author has
investigated is also capable of performing network activity independent of
browser proxy settings - and often independent of its own proxy settings.
In addition, plugins can be used to store unique identifiers that are more
difficult to clear than standard cookies. 
<ulink url="http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html">Flash-based
cookies</ulink> fall into this category, but there are likely numerous other
examples.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Inserting CSS</command>
     <para>

CSS can also be used to correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity, via the usage of
<ulink url="http://www.tjkdesign.com/articles/css%20pop%20ups/">CSS
popups</ulink> - essentially CSS-based event handlers that fetch content via
CSS's onmouseover attribute. If these popups are allowed to perform network
activity in a different Tor state than they were loaded in, they can easily
correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity and reveal a user's IP address. In
addition, CSS can also be used without Javascript to perform <ulink
url="http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history.cgi">CSS-only history disclosure
attacks</ulink>.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Read and insert cookies</command>
     <para>

An adversary in a position to perform MITM content alteration can inject
document content elements to both read and inject cookies for
arbitrary domains. In fact, many "SSL secured" websites are vulnerable to this
sort of <ulink url="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2007/Aug/0070.html">active
sidejacking</ulink>.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Create arbitrary cached content</command>
     <para>

Likewise, the browser cache can also be used to <ulink
url="http://crypto.stanford.edu/sameorigin/safecachetest.html">store unique
identifiers</ulink>. Since by default the cache has no same-origin policy,
these identifiers can be read by any domain, making them an ideal target for
adserver-class adversaries.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Remotely or locally exploit browser and/or
OS</command>
     <para>
Last, but definitely not least, the adversary can exploit either general 
browser vulnerabilities, plugin vulnerabilities, or OS vulnerabilities to
install malware and surveillance software. An adversary with physical access
can perform similar actions. Regrettably, this last attack capability is
outside of Torbutton's ability to defend against, but it is worth mentioning
for completeness.
     </para>

</orderedlist>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="layout">
   <title>Extension Layout</title>

<para>Firefox extensions consist of two main categories of code: 'Components' and
'Chrome'. Components are a fancy name for classes that implement a given
interface or interfaces. In Firefox, components <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/creatingcomps.html">can be
written</ulink> in C++,
Javascript, or a mixture of both. Components have two identifiers: their
'<ulink
url="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/book/cxc/html/quicktour2.html#1005005">Contract
ID</ulink>' (a human readable path-like string), and their '<ulink
url="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/book/cxc/html/quicktour2.html#1005329">Class
ID</ulink>' (a GUID hex-string). In addition, the interfaces they implement each have a hex
'Interface ID'. It is possible to 'hook' system components - to reimplement
their interface members with your own wrappers - but only if the rest of the
browser refers to the component by its Contract ID. If the browser refers to
the component by Class ID, it bypasses your hooks in that use case.
Technically, it may be possible to hook Class IDs by unregistering the
original component, and then re-registering your own, but this relies on
obsolete and deprecated interfaces and has proved to be less than
stable.</para>

<para>'Chrome' is a combination of XML and Javascript used to describe a window.
Extensions are allowed to create 'overlays' that are 'bound' to existing XML
window definitions, or they can create their own windows. The DTD for this XML
is called <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL_Reference">XUL</ulink>.</para>
  </sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>
  <title>Components</title>
  <para>
Torbutton installs components for two purposes: hooking existing components to
reimplement their interfaces to change behavior or receive notification; and
creating its own components for maintaining state and providing services to
other pieces of the extension. 
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>Hooked Components</title>

<para>Torbutton makes extensive use of Contract ID hooking, and implements some
of its own standalone components as well.  Let's discuss the hooked components
first.</para>

<sect3>
 <title><ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/nsISessionStore">@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1</ulink> -
<ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/nsSessionStore.js">components/nsSessionStore.js</ulink></title>

<para>This component addresses the <link linkend="disk">Disk Avoidance</link>
requirements of Torbutton. As stated in the requirements, Torbutton needs to
prevent Tor tabs from being written to disk by the Firefox session store for a
number of reasons, primary among them is the fact that Firefox can crash at
any time, and a restart can cause you to fetch tabs in the incorrect Tor
state.</para>

<para>This component illustrates a complication with Firefox hooking: you can
only hook member functions of a class if they are published in an
interface that the class implements. Unfortunately, the sessionstore has no
published interface that is amenable to disabling the writing out of Tor tabs
in specific. As such, Torbutton had to include the <emphasis>entire</emphasis>
nsSessionStore from the Firefox distribution as one of its components, but
with a couple of modifications to prevent tabs that were loaded with Tor
enabled from being written to disk. The <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/nsSessionStore.diff">diff against the original session
store</ulink> is included in the SVN repository.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title><ulink
url="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStartup.js">@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstartup;1</ulink> -
    <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/crash-observer.js">components/crash-observer.js</ulink></title>

<para>This component wraps the Firefox Session Startup component that is in
charge of <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Session_store_API">restoring saved
sessions</ulink>. The wrapper's only job is to intercept the
<function>doRestore()</function> function, which is called by Firefox if it is determined that the
browser crashed and the session needs to be restored. The wrapper notifies the
Torbutton chrome that the browser crashed by setting the pref
<command>extensions.torbutton.crashed</command>. The Torbutton Chrome <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIPrefBranch2.html#method_addObserver">listens for a
preference change</ulink> for this value and then does the appropriate cleanup. This
includes setting the Tor state to the one the user selected for crash recovery
in the preferences window (<command>extensions.torbutton.restore_tor</command>), and
restoring cookies for the corresponding cookie jar, if it exists.</para>

<para>By performing this notification, this component assists in the 
<link linkend="proxy">Proxy Obedience</link>, and <link
linkend="isolation">Network Isolation</link> requirements.
</para>


</sect3>
<sect3>
<title><ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_browserglobalhistory2.html">@mozilla.org/browser/global-history;2</ulink>
- <ulink
  url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/ignore-history.js">components/ignore-history.js</ulink></title>

<para>This component was contributed by <ulink
url="http://www.collinjackson.com/">Collin Jackson</ulink> as a method for defeating
CSS and Javascript-based methods of history disclosure. The global-history
component is what is used by Firefox to determine if a link was visited or not
(to apply the appropriate style to the link). By hooking the <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIGlobalHistory2.html#method_isVisited">isVisited</ulink>
and <ulink 
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIGlobalHistory2.html#method_addURI">addURI</ulink>
methods, Torbutton is able to selectively prevent history items from being
added or being displayed as visited, depending on the Tor state and the user's
preferences.
</para>
<para>
This component helps satisfy the <link linkend="state">State Separation</link>
and <link linkend="disk">Disk Avoidance</link> requirements of Torbutton.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>New Components</title>

<para>Torbutton creates four new components that are used throughout the
extension. These components do not hook any interfaces, nor are they used
anywhere besides Torbutton itself.</para>

<sect3>
<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cookie-jar-selector.js">@stanford.edu/cookie-jar-selector;2
- components/cookie-jar-selector.js</ulink></title>

<para>The cookie jar selector (also based on code from <ulink
url="http://www.collinjackson.com/">Collin
Jackson</ulink> is used by the Torbutton chrome to switch between
Tor and Non-Tor cookies. Its operations are simple: sync cookies to disk, then
move the current cookies.txt file to the appropriate backup location
(cookies-tor.txt or cookies-nontor.txt), and then moving the other cookie jar
into place.</para>

<para>
This component helps to address the <link linkend="isolation">Network
Isolation</link> requirement of Torbutton.
</para>

</sect3>
<sect3>
<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/torbutton-logger.js">@torproject.org/torbutton-logger;1
- components/torbutton-logger.js</ulink></title>

<para>The torbutton logger component allows on-the-fly redirection of torbutton
logging messages to either Firefox stderr
(<command>extensions.torbutton.logmethod=0</command>), the Javascript error console
(<command>extensions.torbutton.logmethod=1</command>), or the DebugLogger extension (if
available - <command>extensions.torbutton.logmethod=2</command>). It also allows you to
change the loglevel on the fly by changing
<command>extensions.torbutton.loglevel</command> (1-5, 1 is most verbose).
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>

<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/window-mapper.js">@torproject.org/content-window-mapper;1
- components/window-mapper.js</ulink></title>

<para>Torbutton tags Firefox <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_tabbrowser.html">tabs</ulink> with a special variable that indicates the Tor
state the tab was most recently used under to fetch a page. The problem is
that for many Firefox events, it is not possible to determine the tab that is
actually receiving the event. The Torbutton window mapper allows the Torbutton
chrome and other components to look up a <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_tabbrowser.html">browser
tab</ulink> for a given <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIDOMWindow.html">html content
window</ulink>. It does this by traversing all windows and all browsers, until it
finds the browser with the requested <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_browser.html#prop_contentWindow">contentWindow</ulink> element. Since the content policy
and page loading in general can generate hundreds of these lookups, this
result is cached inside the component.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="contentpolicy">
<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cssblocker.js">@torproject.org/cssblocker;1
- components/cssblocker.js</ulink></title>

<para>This is a key component to Torbutton's security measures. When Tor is
toggled, Javascript is disabled, and pages are instructed to stop loading.
However, CSS is still able to perform network operations by loading styles for
onmouseover events and other operations. In addition, favicons can still be
loaded by the browser. The cssblocker component prevents this by implementing
and registering an <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIContentPolicy.html">nsIContentPolicy</ulink>.
When an nsIContentPolicy is registered, Firefox checks every attempted network
request against its <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIContentPolicy.html#method_shouldLoad">shouldLoad</ulink>
member function to determine if the load should proceed. In Torbutton's case,
the content policy looks up the appropriate browser tab using the window mapper,
and checks that tab's load tag against the current Tor state. If the tab was
loaded in a different state than the current state, the fetch is denied.
Otherwise, it is allowed.</para>

<para>
This component helps to address the <link linkend="state">State
Separation</link> requirement of Torbutton.
</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>
 <title>Chrome</title>

<para>The chrome is where all the torbutton graphical elements and windows are
located. Each window is described as an <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL_Reference">XML file</ulink>, with zero or more Javascript
files attached. The scope of these Javascript files is their containing
window.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Browser Overlay - <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/torbutton.xul">torbutton.xul</ulink></title>

<para>The browser overlay, torbutton.xul, defines the toolbar button, the status
bar, and events for toggling the button. The overlay code is in <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/torbutton.js">chrome/content/torbutton.js</ulink>.
It contains event handlers for preference update, shutdown, upgrade, and
location change events.</para>

<para>The <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_docloaderservice1.html">location
change</ulink> <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIWebProgressListener.html">webprogress
listener</ulink>, <command>torbutton_weblistener</command> is perhaps the
most important part of the chrome from a security standpoint. It is a <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIWebProgressListener.html">web
progress listener</ulink> that handles
receiving an event every time a page load or iframe load occurs. This class
eventually calls down to <function>torbutton_update_tags()</function> and 
<function>torbutton_hookdoc()</function>, which apply the browser Tor load state tags, plugin
permissions, and install the Javascript hooks to hook the <ulink
url="http://phrogz.net/objJob/object.asp?id=224">Date</ulink> object and
the <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.navigator">navigator</ulink> object (for timezone and platform information,
respectively).</para> 
<para>
The browser overlay helps to satisfy a number of Torbutton requirements. These
are better enumerated in each of the Torbutton preferences below.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
 <title>Preferences Window - <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/preferences.xul">preferences.xul</ulink></title>

<para>The preferences window of course lays out the Torbutton preferences, with
handlers located in <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/preferences.js">chrome/content/preferences.js</ulink>.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
 <title>Other Windows</title>

<para>There are additional windows that describe popups for right clicking on the
status bar, the toolbutton, and the about page.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>
 <title>Description of Options</title>

<para>This section provides a detailed description of Torbutton's options. Each
option is presented as the string from the preferences window, a summary, the
preferences it touches, and the effect this has on the components, chrome, and
browser properties.</para>
 <sect2 id="plugins">
  <title>Disable plugins on Tor Usage (crucial)</title>

 <para>Option: <command>extensions.torbutton.no_tor_plugins</command></para>

 <para>Enabling this preference causes the above mentioned Torbutton chrome web progress
 listener <command>torbutton_weblistener</command> to disable Java via <command>security.enable_java</command> and to disable
 plugins via the browser <ulink
 url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIDocShell.html">docShell</ulink>
 attribute <command>allowPlugins</command>. These flags are set every time a new window is
 created (<function>torbutton_tag_new_browser()</function>), every time a web
load
event occurs
 (<function>torbutton_update_tags()</function>)), and every time the tor state is changed
 (<function>torbutton_update_status()</function>). As a backup measure, plugins are also
 prevented from loading by the content policy in <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cssblocker.js">@torproject.org/cssblocker;1</ulink> if Tor is
 enabled and this option is set.
 </para> 
 
 <para>Even all this turns out to be insufficient if the user directly
 clicks on a plugin-handled mime-type. <ulink
url="http://www.janusvm.com/goldy/pdf/">In this case</ulink>, the browser decides that
 maybe it should ignore all these other settings and load the plugin anyways,
 because maybe the user really did want to load it (never mind this same
 load-style could happen automatically  with meta-refresh or any number of
 other ways..). To handle this case, Torbutton stores a list of plugin-handled
 mime-types, and if it detects a load of one of them from the web progress
 listener, it attempts to cancel the request. For some reason, this is not
 always sufficient. In fact, the only way I was able to prevent the plugin
 from loading reliably was to cancel the request, tell the DOMWindow to stop,
 clear the document, AND throw an exception. Anything short of all this and
 the plugin managed to find some way to load.
 </para>
 
 <para>
 All this could be avoided, of course, if Firefox would either <ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=401296">obey
 allowPlugins</ulink> for directly visited urls, or notify its content policy for such
 loads either <ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309524">via</ulink> <ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380556">shouldProcess</ulink> or shouldLoad. The fact that it does not is
 not very encouraging. 
 </para>
 <para>

Since most plugins completely ignore browser proxy settings, the actions
performed by this setting are crucial to satisfying the <link
linkend="proxy">Proxy Obedience</link> requirement.

 </para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
 <title>Isolate Dynamic Content to Tor State (crucial)</title>

 <para>Option: <command>extensions.torbutton.isolate_content</command></para>

<para>Enabling this preference is what enables the <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cssblocker.js">@torproject.org/cssblocker;1</ulink> content policy
mentioned above, and causes it to block content load attempts in pages an
opposite Tor state from the current state. Freshly loaded <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_tabbrowser.html">browser
tabs</ulink> are tagged 
with a <command>__tb_load_state</command> member in
<function>torbutton_update_tags()</function> and this
value is compared against the current tor state in the content policy.</para>

<para>It also kills all Javascript in each page loaded under that state by
toggling the <command>allowJavascript</command> <ulink

  <title>Testing</title>
  <para>

The purpose of this section is to cover all the known ways that Tor browser
security can be subverted from a testing and penetration perspective. The hope
is that it will be useful both for creating a &quot;Tor Safety Check&quot;
page, and for developing novel tests and actively attacking Torbutton with the
goal of finding vulnerabilities in either it or the Mozilla components,
interfaces and settings upon which it relies.
 
  </para> 
  <sect2 id="Categories">
   <title>Single state testing</title>
   <para>
The following tests can be run from a single web page in one visit without
toggling Tor state or requiring user interaction. Currently they exist as their
own individual tests, but conceivably a single &quot;Tor Safety Check&quot;
page can be devised that contains all of these attacks. 
All of these tests are currently known to pass, but that does not mean that
consolidating them into an easy to run test page is pointless. Torbutton is a
complicated piece of software. During development, changes to one component
can affect a whole slough of unrelated features. Having easy-to-verify
comprehensive test pages would make it much easier to fix other issues as they
present themselves without introducing regressions.

address</ulink> and report it back to the
remote site. They can also <ulink url="http://metasploit.com/research/misc/decloak/index.htm">bypass proxy settings</ulink> and directly connect to a
remote site without Tor. Every browser plugin we have tested with Firefox has
some form of network capability, and every one ignores proxy settings or worse - only

The most obvious test is to set a cookie, ask the user to toggle tor, and then
have them reload the page. The cookie should no longer be set if they are
using the default Torbutton settings. In addition, it is possible to leverage
the cache to <ulink
url="http://crypto.stanford.edu/sameorigin/safecachetest.html">store unique
identifiers</ulink>. The default settings of Torbutton should also protect
against these from persisting across Tor Toggle.

activity as soon as the mouse enters into the content window. It is also
possible for meta-refresh tags to set timers long enough to make it likely
that the user has toggled Tor before fetching content.

  <sect2>
   <title>Active testing (aka How to Hack Torbutton)</title>
   <para>

The idea behind active testing is to discover vulnerabilities in Torbutton to
bypass proxy settings, run script in an opposite Tor state, store unique
identifiers, leak location information, or otherwise violate <link
linkend="requirements">its requirements</link>. Torbutton has ventured out
into a strange and new security landscape. It depends on Firefox mechanisms
that haven't necessarily been audited for security, certainly not for the
threat model that Torbutton seeks to address. As such, it and the interfaces
it depends upon still need a 'trial by fire' typical of new technologies. This
section of the document was written with the intention of making that period
as fast as possible. Please help us get through this period by considering
these attacks, playing with them, and reporting what you find (and potentially
submitting the test cases back to be run in the standard batch of Torbutton
tests.

     <listitem>The Date and Timezone hooks should be verified to work with
crazy combinations of iframes, nested iframes, iframes in frames, frames in
iframes, and popups being loaded and
reloaded in rapid succession. Think race conditions and deep, 
parallel nesting, involving iframes from both <ulink
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same-origin and
non-same-origin</ulink> domains.</listitem>
     <listitem>Similarly, is there any way to confuse the <link
linkend="contentpolicy">content policy</link>
mentioned above to cause it to allow certain types of page fetches? For
example, it was recently discovered that favicons are not fetched by the
content, but the chrome itself, hence the content policy did not look up the
correct window to determine the current Tor tag for the favicon fetch. Are
there other things that can do this? Popups? Bookmarklets? Active bookmarks? </listitem>
     <listitem>In addition, there may be alternate ways and other
methods to query the timezone, or otherwise use some of the Date object's
methods in combination to deduce the timezone offset. Of course, the author
tried his best to cover all the methods he could foresee, but it's always good
to have another set of eyes try it out.</listitem>
     <listitem>Alternate ways to store and fetch unique identifiers. For example, <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:Storage">DOM Storage</ulink> caught us offguard. Are there any other
arcane or experimental ways that Firefox provides to create and store unique
identifiers? Or perhaps unique identifiers can be queried or derived from
properties of the machine/browser that Javascript has access to? How unique
can these identifiers be?
     </listitem>
     <listitem>Is it possible to get the browser to write some history to disk
(aside from swap) that can be retrieved later? By default, Torbutton should
write no history, cookie, or other browsing activity information to the
harddisk.</listitem>
     <listitem>Do popup windows make it easier to break any of the above
behavior? Are javascript events still canceled in popups? What about CSS
popups? Are they still blocked after Tor is toggled?</listitem>
     <listitem>Chrome-escalation attacks. The interaction between the
Torbutton chrome Javascript and the client content window javascript is pretty
well-defined and carefully constructed, but perhaps there is a way to smuggle
javascript back in a return value, or otherwise inject network-loaded
javascript into the chrome (and thus gain complete control of the browser).
